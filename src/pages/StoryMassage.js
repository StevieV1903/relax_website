                <p>We all love stories. When combined with the benefits of simple massage strokes, stories present wonderful opportunities for creative fun and interaction. Sharing positive touch offers great scope for imaginative activity and learning for children of all ages and abilities.
                </p> 
                <p>
                The Story Massage Programme combines the benefits of positive touch with the fun and creativity of words â€“ whether as story, rhyme or song.  Ten simple massage strokes form the basis of the programme. These strokes have a name, such as The Circle or The Sprinkle, and an easy to recognise symbol making it fully accessible for all ages and abilities.
                </p> 
                <p>
                Story Massage offers a way of learning and communicating through play and positive interaction. You can adapt your own massage stories from favourite stories and nursery rhymes, or have fun creating your own stories to reflect particular interests, activities or events. 
                </p>     
                <p>
                There is also an educational element as the Story Massage Programme can be used to fit in with the national curriculum. Many children have learnt their numbers and letters, plus history, geography and nature through massage stories.
